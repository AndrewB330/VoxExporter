# VoxExporter [In Dev]

__VoxExporter__ is a library that has a lot of functionality that helps to export voxel models 
from .vox format into .obj format. The key feature of VoxExporter is that it creates custom uv-unwrapping of 
model texture, and do not use default 256px palette-texture. With custom uv-s it is possible to easily bake lightmaps
in Unity3D, Blender etc.

## Example of unwrapped texture
